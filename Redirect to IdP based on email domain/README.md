<Under construction>

When a user enters an email address, he/she must click on verify account to continue. Depending on the email domain, the user will be redirected to the corresponding sign-in page, using domain_hint. If there is no match, then it can be redirected to a default sign-in page with all the IdPs configured. If the account doesn't exist, it can be redirected to a default sign-up page.

The logic of this use case is being defined.
